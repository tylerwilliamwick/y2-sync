---

HifiMule is a desktop application that bridges open source media servers and portable music players — from legacy mass-storage MP3 players to modern DAPs, MTP phones, and Garmin smartwatches. It supports [Jellyfin](https://jellyfin.org/) and Subsonic-compatible servers such as [Navidrome](https://www.navidrome.org/), and can manage several servers at once. Browse your library, listen directly on your computer, preview tracks, and manage your playback queue. Pick what you want (or let auto-fill do it for you) and sync it to your device with delta transfers and resume support. Runs on Windows and macOS.

## Features

- **Multi-server hub** — Connect several media servers (any mix of Jellyfin, Subsonic, and Navidrome), name them, give them custom icons, and switch with a click. Your basket can hold music from multiple servers at once, syncing each item back to where it came from.
- **Local music folders** — Add an owned-music folder as a read-only browse and sync source; symlinks are never followed and full local paths stay out of the UI.
- **Reviewed metadata cleanup** — Audit embedded tags and artwork, compare scored MusicBrainz candidates, and write only after explicit review. Writes are stale-safe, verified, and retain the original as a hidden backup.
- **Algorithmic local playlists** — Preview deterministic Discovery, Weekly, and Daily mixes, or import ListenBrainz Weekly Exploration, Weekly Jams, and Daily Jams. Imports match owned files and report missing recommendations; they never download audio.
- **Rich library browsing** — Nine browse modes: Artists, Albums, Playlists, Tracks, Genres, Recently Added, Frequently Played, Recently Played, and Favorites. Switch between grid and list views with an A–Z jump strip for large collections.
- **Built-in audio playback** — Play albums directly from your media server on your computer, with pause/resume, previous/next, seeking, and audio output selection.
- **Track previews** — Preview a track while browsing, then return to your listening session.
- **Playback queue** — Add tracks to the queue, view listening history and upcoming tracks, and reorder or remove upcoming tracks.
- **Multi-select** — Tick checkboxes (or Ctrl/Cmd-click and Shift-click for ranges) to add many items to your basket or a playlist in one action.
- **Playlist editing** — Create, rename, delete, and reorder playlists; add or remove tracks; or turn your basket into a new playlist. Works on Jellyfin and Subsonic/Navidrome.
- **Auto-fill** — Automatically fill a device to a size or duration budget from your library, favorites, history, or playlists — with ordering rules, genre filters, quality/version preferences, and discovery mechanics (rarity, pity, context windows).
- **Selective & delta sync** — Add items to a sync basket and transfer only what you choose; HifiMule compares local and remote state and downloads only what's changed.
- **Quality-aware** — Tracks the bitrate of every file written and re-downloads when a higher-quality version appears; a Force Sync option wipes and re-downloads everything.
- **Resumable & cancellable transfers** — Interrupted syncs pick up where they left off, and a running sync can be cancelled cleanly. The sync preview explains *why* each file is added or removed.
- **Auto-sync** — Devices can sync automatically the moment they're connected.
- **Broad device support** — Built-in profiles for Rockbox players, Garmin smartwatches, modern DAPs, Sony Walkman, generic MP3 players, car USB sticks, and audiobook/podcast devices, plus MTP phones. Transcoding profiles convert audio to a device-compatible format only when needed.
- **Device management** — Initialize and edit devices, inspect storage, and configure name, icon, transcoding profile, music folder, and a separate playlist folder.
- **Manifest tracking** — A `.hifimule.json` manifest on-device tracks synced files with repair, prune, and relink tools.
- **Scrobble bridge** — Reads Rockbox playback logs and reports listening history back to your media server.
- **System tray daemon** — Runs in the background with status indicators (idle, scanning, syncing, error).
- **Hardware-aware** — Validates path lengths and filename character sets for legacy devices.
- **Multilanguage** — English, French, Spanish, and German.
- **Secure credentials** — Stores server credentials in a local, machine-bound encrypted vault, never in plain text.

## Disclaimer

This software was developed with the assistance of AI and the BMAD Method. As an experienced software developer, I have thoroughly validated the code to ensure its quality and reliability.


## Architecture

```
┌─────────────┐      JSON-RPC 2.0       ┌─────────────────┐      HTTP      ┌─────────────────────────┐
│  Tauri UI   │ ◄──────────────────────►│  Rust Daemon    │ ◄────────────► │ Jellyfin / Navidrome /  │
│  (Desktop)  │    127.0.0.1:19140      │  (System Tray)  │                │ Subsonic (one or more)  │
└─────────────┘                         └─────────────────┘                └─────────────────────────┘
```

Two-process design: the daemon handles audio playback alongside sync, provider, and device operations while the UI is a detachable Tauri window. A pluggable provider layer abstracts Jellyfin and Subsonic-compatible servers, and a server manager keeps multiple configured servers with a stable identity that travels with your devices. The daemon continues working even if the UI is closed, with an idle memory footprint under 10 MB.

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|-------|-----------|
| Daemon | Rust, Tokio, Axum, Reqwest, SQLite (rusqlite), tray-icon |
| Audio playback | FFmpeg decoding, CPAL audio output, Souvlaki media controls |
| Devices | Mass-storage (USB), MTP via libmtp |
| UI | TypeScript, Tauri 2, Vite, Shoelace web components |
| i18n | Shared `hifimule-i18n` catalog crate (en, fr, es, de) |
| Communication | JSON-RPC 2.0 over HTTP |
| Credentials | Machine-bound encrypted vault (ChaCha20-Poly1305) |
| Build | Cargo workspaces, npm scripts, Tauri bundler |

## Prerequisites

- **Rust** 1.93.0+ ([rustup](https://rustup.rs/))
- **Node.js** LTS ([nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/))
- **npm** (bundled with Node)
- Platform-specific Tauri dependencies — see the [Tauri prerequisites guide](https://v2.tauri.app/start/prerequisites/)

## Getting Started

```bash
# Clone
git clone <repository-url>
cd HifiMule

# Install dependencies
npm install
cd hifimule-ui && npm install && cd ..

# Development (two terminals)
# Terminal 1 — daemon
npm run build:daemon -- run -p hifimule-daemon

# Terminal 2 — UI with hot-reload
cd hifimule-ui
npx tauri dev
```

### Build for release

```bash
npm run build            # Full build (UI + daemon)
npm run build:ui         # UI only (Tauri bundle)
npm run build:daemon     # Daemon release binary with the controlled audio runtime
```

### Run tests

```bash
npm run build:daemon -- test --workspace   # All workspace tests
```

Use `npm run build:daemon -- <cargo arguments>` for daemon-related Cargo
commands. The wrapper provisions the pinned FFmpeg runtime and exports the
native build environment before Cargo starts. A raw `cargo build` cannot do
that early enough for dependency build scripts on Linux or Windows.

## How It Works

1. **Connect** — Add one or more media servers (Jellyfin, Navidrome, or any Subsonic-compatible server), or choose a local music folder
2. **Browse** — Navigate your library across nine browse modes, switching servers as you go
3. **Play** — Start an album or preview a track directly in HifiMule; use the playback controls and queue to manage your listening session
4. **Select** — Add items to the sync basket — one at a time, in bulk, or automatically with auto-fill
5. **Plug in** — Connect your portable device, initialize it, and configure its folders and transcoding profile
6. **Sync** — HifiMule calculates deltas and transfers only what's needed; syncs can resume or be cancelled
7. **Listen on the go** — Play music on your device; scrobble logs sync back to your media server

For a selected local folder, open **Server Hub → Library tools** to audit metadata or preview and create relative UTF-8 playlists. Metadata changes always require choosing a MusicBrainz candidate and checking the review confirmation first.

### Listening in HifiMule

- Use an album’s play button to start listening on your computer. Control playback with pause/resume, previous/next, stop, and the seek bar.
- Use a track’s preview button to try it while browsing. **Return to session** takes you back to your main listening session.
- Use **Add to queue** on tracks to build your listening queue. Open the playback view to see listening history and **Upcoming** tracks, then move upcoming tracks up or down or remove them.
- Choose an **Audio output** from the playback controls to listen through your preferred device.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Please open an issue to discuss changes before submitting a PR.
As I'm mostly using Windows as the development platform for HifiMule, I'm looking for feedback from Linux or Mac users.
I'm also looking for feedback from owners of various devices, as my collection is quite limited.
